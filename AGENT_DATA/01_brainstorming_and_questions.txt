ALBUM DOWNLOAD SITE — BRAINSTORMING & CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
================================================================================

BRAINSTORMING
-------------

Core idea:
  - Physical booklet (CD booklet / merch) contains a QR code
  - QR → unique URL → page where user can download the album (limited times)
  - You need to generate many such URLs (one per booklet) and print QR for each

User flow:
  1. Customer buys booklet → scans QR (or types URL from booklet)
  2. Lands on e.g. album.konaboj.cz/download/<unique-id>
  3. Page shows: download button + message if already used / how many left
  4. Click download → get the album (ZIP/MP3/whatever)

What you need to be able to do (without a full backoffice):
  - Generate new “tokens” (unique IDs) in bulk or one-by-one
  - For each token: get a QR code image you can put in the booklet
  - Optionally: see how many times a link was used (could be via simple report or one-off script)

Design / content:
  - Main site (album.konaboj.cz): info about the album, band, maybe note “use the code from your booklet”
  - Styling should match konaboj.cz: simple, clear, Moravian folk-rock / world music vibe
  - Download page: minimal — trust message, download button, and status (e.g. “Already used” or “X downloads left”)

Security / abuse:
  - IDs must be unguessable (crypto random, long enough)
  - Optional: rate limiting so one IP cannot hammer the same link
  - Optional: cap total downloads per token (e.g. 1–3 per purchase)

CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download limit per QR/link
   - Exactly 1 download per link (one-time use)?
   - Or a small number (e.g. 2–3) so the buyer can re-download on another device?
   → Affects whether you need to store “remaining count” or just “used yes/no”.
   Answer: This should be configurable, I want to display remaining count.

2) What are you actually serving as “the album”?
   - Single ZIP with MP3s (and maybe artwork)?
   - Streaming + download?
   - Multiple formats (MP3 + FLAC)?
   → Affects file size, hosting (bandwidth, storage), and page UX.
   Answer: I guess ZIP should be fine. It can contain all sorts of data.

3) How will you generate new QR codes in practice?
   - Once before print run: generate 500 tokens + 500 QR images, then send to printer?
   - Or occasionally: generate 10 new links when you prepare 10 new booklets?
   → Decides between “one-off script” vs “minimal generator tool” (CLI or single admin page).
   Answer: We will generate initial bulk, lets say 200 tokens. Then I need an option to generate more as I need. It can be 1 or 1000.

4) Do you need to know “this link was used on date X” or “link #47 was used”?
   - For accounting / proof of sale: no need for backoffice, but a simple export (CSV/JSON) or read-only list might help.
   - Or you truly don’t care as long as the limit is enforced.
   Answer: I would prefer to know date and time when the link is exhausted (Reached the limit)

5) Hosting preference and budget
   - Prefer free/cheap (Netlify, Vercel, static + serverless)?
   - Or OK with a small VPS (e.g. 5 EUR/month) for a tiny backend that reads/writes a file?
   → “No database” is possible in both cases, but the implementation differs (serverless + KV vs single server + JSON/SQLite file).
   Answer: I prefer free/cheap option.

6) Domain and SSL
   - album.konaboj.cz — do you already own konaboj.cz and can add a subdomain?
   - SSL (HTTPS) is a must for modern browsers and user trust.
   Answer: SSL is must for me. The album.konaboj.cz is just an example, it could be any address.

7) Editable content
   - “Easily editable” = change text/colors/images without touching code (e.g. Markdown + config)?
   - Or “we’re OK editing HTML/React and redeploying”?
   → Influences choice of stack (plain HTML + config file vs CMS vs simple static generator).
   Answer: Im OK with editing HTML/React and redeploying.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSUMPTIONS (if you don’t need to decide now)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- One unique URL per booklet; URL is unguessable (e.g. 128-bit random token).
- You’re OK with a small generator script/tool (run on your PC) to create tokens and QR images; no full admin panel.
- Main page is mostly static (info + link to “use your booklet code”).
- Download page is dynamic only in the sense: “does this token exist and how many downloads left?” then serve file or show “used”.
